### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data
### Description
In this project, we will explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. We import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. We will also take in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
